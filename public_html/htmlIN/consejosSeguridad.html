            <p>When creating your profile, remember that all the information you share can be seen by others. Think about what data is needed and what is not. To protect yourself, avoid introducing very specific personal information, such as your address, phone number, specific workplace or daily routine details. If you decide to share something, it's best to do it after you've established a relationship of trust.</p>
            <p>When you talk to a new person, keep your conversations inside the app. Dating platforms, like this one, offer greater security compared to external messaging applications, because they have moderation and protection functions. If someone asks you quickly to speak from another network or asks you for personal information, this can be an alert signal.</p>
            <p>Also, when planning a face-to-face appointment or meeting, choose a public place and make sure you inform a friend or family member of your plans. You can share your location in real time with someone you trust to increase your security during the appointment. Don't hesitate and take the time you need to meet the person before you meet him in person.</p>
            <p>Believe in your instincts and report any suspicious behavior. If someone in the app makes you uncomfortable or presses you to share personal information or find it quickly, don't hesitate to report it or block it. We're here to help you maintain a safe experience, and taking those actions not only protects you, but helps make the platform safe for everyone.</p>
            <p>Finally, remember that building trust takes time. Don't feel pressure to share more than you want. It is important to set limits, and any real person will understand and respect it. Use the app with confidence, following these advice, and enjoy the connections you can make here, knowing you're taking steps to keep it safe.</p>
